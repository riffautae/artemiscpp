Artemis
=======
This is a C++ port of the [Artemis Entity Framework](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). 

Basic testing indicates it passes as usable in simple games but should be considered pre-alpha quality.

Required Libraries
------------------
* Boost

    I use BOOST_FOREACH and shared_ptr. My use of shared_ptr may be excessive.
